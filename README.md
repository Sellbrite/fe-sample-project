# Shopping Cart Project
=======

This was a timed code challenge to implement a simple shopping from a pdf reference guide. It was built using AngularJS, node, and express. Gulp was implemented to compile. 

## Features include:

#### Backend

* Returns a JSON object of products
* Routes and responses are separated out to maximize scalability and readability

#### Frontend

* Allows for adding items
* Provides "preview" cart mode, which gives user the ability to view and remove items in the cart
* Product cards are responsive on hover as specified in the pdf styleguide 
* Cart product total is updated dynamically in navbar 
* Cart preview mimics a modal featureset 

## Given more time and put to production I would:

* I would add a separate sibling view for the shopping cart page
* Implement a modal directive for the the shopping cart "preview" on the product page
* Update mobile responsiveness of cart preview
